# Ethan's Homelab

![alt text](<Windows Server Active Directory/screenshots/homelab.png>)

The purpose of this repo is to document my journey and the processes I use through building homelab projects to aid my learning in the world of IT. I actively work on these projects in my free time, mostly in early mornings or over weekends.

# About

Hi, I'm Ethan! I love messing with tech and breaking things, learning from those broken things and hopefully not making the same mistake twice!
I live in South Carolina with my wife and two children. In my spare time (when I'm not working on these labs!) I enjoy reading, playing the guitar, attending my church, and spending time outdoors with my family.
